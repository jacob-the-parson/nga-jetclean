Roof Soft Wash Cleaning
Extend your roof's lifespan by safely removing harmful moss, algae, and contaminants
Vinyl Siding
Recommended Pressure: 1,300-1,800 PSI
Water Temperature: Cold to Warm
Nozzle Type: 25° to 40°
Cleaning Method: Soft Wash with Detergent
Vinyl siding requires a gentle approach to avoid damage while still effectively removing dirt, mold, and mildew. We use a specialized soft washing technique with eco-friendly detergents that break down organic growth without harming your siding or surrounding landscaping.
Our technicians maintain a safe distance from the surface and work from top to bottom in a controlled pattern to ensure even cleaning without forcing water behind the siding panels, which could lead to moisture issues.
Concrete Surfaces
Recommended Pressure: 2,500-3,000 PSI
Water Temperature: Cold to Hot
Nozzle Type: 15° to 25°
Cleaning Method: Surface Cleaner + Pre-treatment
Concrete driveways, sidewalks, and patios can withstand higher pressure, which is necessary to remove deep-set stains, oil spots, and organic growth. We use professional-grade surface cleaners that provide consistent, streak-free results.
For stubborn stains, we apply specialized pre-treatments that break down oils and other contaminants before pressure washing. After cleaning, we offer optional sealing services to protect your concrete from future staining and extend the time between cleanings.
Asphalt Shingles
Recommended Pressure: No Direct Pressure
Water Temperature: Cold Only
Nozzle Type: Soft Wash Nozzle
Cleaning Method: Chemical Treatment Only
Asphalt shingle roofs should never be pressure washed as it can remove granules and significantly shorten roof life. Instead, we use a specialized "soft wash" system that applies a gentle cleaning solution to kill algae, moss, and lichen without damaging shingles.
Our roof cleaning solution continues working after application, gradually removing all organic growth over 1-2 weeks. This method is approved by shingle manufacturers and won't void your roof warranty like pressure washing might.
Wood Decks
Recommended Pressure: 500-1,200 PSI
Water Temperature: Cold to Warm
Nozzle Type: 40° to 60°
Cleaning Method: Low Pressure + Wood Cleaner
Wood decks require special care to clean effectively without causing damage. We use low pressure combined with specialized wood cleaning solutions to remove dirt, mildew, and algae while preserving the wood's integrity.
Our technicians are trained to maintain the proper distance and angle to prevent etching or splintering the wood. After cleaning, we recommend a protective stain or sealant application to enhance the wood's natural beauty and protect it from moisture, UV damage, and future staining.
Brick & Stone
Recommended Pressure: 1,500-2,000 PSI
Water Temperature: Cold to Hot
Nozzle Type: 25° to 40°
Cleaning Method: Moderate Pressure + Masonry Cleaner
Brick and stone surfaces are durable but porous, requiring careful cleaning to remove dirt, moss, and efflorescence (white mineral deposits) without damaging the mortar joints. We use specialized masonry cleaners and controlled pressure to restore these surfaces.
For historic or older brick, we adjust our approach to use gentler methods that won't damage deteriorated mortar or soft, older bricks. After cleaning, we can apply a breathable sealer that prevents water penetration while allowing the masonry to release moisture naturally.
Initial Assessment
We begin with a thorough assessment of your property to determine the best cleaning approach for your specific surfaces.
Surface Preparation
We carefully prepare the surrounding area, protecting plants, electrical fixtures, and other sensitive items from water and cleaning solutions.
Pre-Treatment Application
When necessary, we apply eco-friendly cleaning solutions to break down tough stains and biological growth before pressure washing.
Precision Cleaning
Using state-of-the-art equipment, we clean your surfaces with the appropriate pressure and technique for optimal results without damage.
Final Inspection
We conduct a final walk-through with you to ensure everything meets our high standards and your complete satisfaction.

How often should I have my home exterior cleaned?
For most homes in the North Georgia area, we recommend exterior cleaning every 12-18 months. However, homes in heavily wooded areas or with significant shade may need cleaning more frequently (every 8-12 months) due to faster mold and mildew growth. During your first service, we can assess your specific situation and recommend an optimal maintenance schedule.
Is pressure washing safe for all surfaces?
No, high-pressure washing isn't suitable for all surfaces. That's why we use various techniques, including soft washing for delicate surfaces like roofs, stucco, and some siding types. Our experienced technicians know exactly which pressure levels and cleaning methods are appropriate for each surface to ensure effective cleaning without causing damage.
Are your cleaning solutions safe for my plants and pets?
Yes, we use environmentally responsible cleaning solutions that are biodegradable and safe for your landscaping when properly applied. Before any cleaning begins, we take precautions by pre-wetting plants and covering sensitive areas. After cleaning, we thoroughly rinse all treated areas to ensure no residue remains that could harm your plants or pets.
How long does a typical pressure washing service take?
Service times vary depending on the size of your property and the specific services requested. A standard driveway cleaning might take 1-2 hours, while a complete home exterior package (including house, driveway, and sidewalks) typically takes 3-5 hours. When we provide your quote, we'll include an estimated timeline so you can plan accordingly.
Do I need to be home during the service?
While we appreciate you being available at the beginning of service to discuss any specific concerns and at the end for a final inspection, it's not required that you remain home throughout the entire process. Many of our customers prefer to go about their day while we work. We just need access to water connections and any areas that need to be cleaned.
How soon can you schedule my cleaning service?
During peak season (spring and summer), our typical lead time is 1-2 weeks. During off-peak months, we can often accommodate appointments within 2-5 days. For urgent situations, we do our best to fit you in sooner. We recommend booking in advance for regular maintenance to ensure you get your preferred time slot.

# CSS Merge Strategy

## Current Issues Identified
1. Duplicate styles between styles.css and mobile-fixes.css
2. Conflicting styles for the same elements (especially responsive styles)
3. Inconsistent use of !important flags
4. Multiple definitions of the same properties at different breakpoints
5. Specific issue with hero and features sections gap that was fixed with padding adjustments

## CSS Variables
- mobile-fixes.css has CSS variables defined, but styles.css doesn't use them
- We should consolidate all variables at the top of the merged file

## Merge Approach
1. Create a new merged CSS file (merged-styles.css)
2. Structure the file in this order:
   - CSS Variables (from mobile-fixes.css)
   - Reset/Base styles
   - Typography
   - Layout/Grid
   - Components (alphabetically)
   - Utility classes
   - Media queries (organized by breakpoint)

3. For the hero/features sections specifically:
   - Keep padding-bottom: 0 for hero section
   - Keep padding-top: 0 for features section
   - Remove duplicate service-video-banner height definitions
   - Consolidate responsive styles

4. Media Query Strategy:
   - Group all styles for the same breakpoint together
   - Use a mobile-first approach where possible
   - Remove !important flags where not necessary
   - Ensure specificity is handled properly

## Implementation Steps
1. âœ… Create merged-styles.css file
2. âœ… Copy CSS variables from mobile-fixes.css
3. âœ… Copy base styles from styles.css
4. âœ… Add hero and features sections with fixed padding (0 bottom/top)
5. âœ… Add consolidated media queries for responsive styles
6. ðŸ”„ Continue merging remaining styles from both files
7. âœ… Update HTML to reference the new merged CSS file
8. âœ… Test the merged file (initial test)
